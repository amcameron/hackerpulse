HackerPulse - Painless Portfolios for Hackers
---

Let the hacker community know what you have been up to lately without
the hassle.

HackerPulse aggregates your public programming-related activities into a unique portfolio that 
represents your online *pulse*. It makes it easy to see what projects you are
working on or what you are reading and commenting about.

Spend less time posting about what you're doing and more time actually doing it.

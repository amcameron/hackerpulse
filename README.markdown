HackerPulse - Painless Portfolios for Hackers
---

Let the hacker community know what you have been up to lately without
the hassle.

HackerPulse aggregates your public online activity into your own unique portfolio that represents your online pulse. Making easy for you and others to see what you have been up to lately, so you can spend less time posting about what you have been up to and more time hacking on world changing projects.

### Sound Cool? Want to contribute?
Do you love python? Keen to work with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)?

Then come chat with us in __#hackerpulse__ on __irc.freenode.net__

We are currently in the planning phase, and will have a feature list for what
we consider the minimum viable product done and some tasks broken out in the next few days.

Until then, you can checkout the [ui mockup](http://i.imgur.com/pmvnU.png), and toss snippets, prototypes and ideas onto irc or into the github repository.

hackerpulse - painless portfolios for hackers

let the hacker community know what you've been up to lately, no-hassle
feeds pull in your recent activity automatically so you are free to 
work on your projects, not waste time talking about them!

sound cool?
we are in #hackerpulse on freenode if you want to help

i'm in! what can i do?
hopefully we will have a mini-feature list and some tasks broken-down
in the next day or two. until then feel free to toss up snippets, prototypes,
or ideas into the repo or IRC

the current 'stack' is Flask and mongoDB (subject to change)
